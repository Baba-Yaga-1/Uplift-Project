# CSS GRID

CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), may be a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces.
<br>
A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we will line up our design elements. They help us to make layouts during which our elements won't jump around or change width as we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on our websites.
<br>
A grid will typically have columns, rows, then gaps between each row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.
<br>
<br>
To get started you've got to define a container element as a grid with ```display: grid``` or ```display: inline-grid```, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.
